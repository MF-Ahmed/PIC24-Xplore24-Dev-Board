You will be required to enter the following 
Serial# MTI030340303 during the installation
of the dsPIC Language Tools, v1.20. 

---------------------------------
I found these 2 serials separately, just thought they may be useful.

---------------------------------
Four years ago I disassembled C30 and came to this conclusion regarding serial numbers:

Use included license manager (pic30-lm.exe) with the following switches:
-ix=DDMMYYYY : make demo last to date MM/DD-YYYY
-iu=XXX : make demo last XXX days

or finally make it full version
-uMTIxxyy4zzzz (where xx=01-04, yy=01-53, zzzz=0001-9999)

(example: -uMTI035248989 is a valid licensenumber)

According to these findings MTI074042127 would be an invalid serial. There were some date checks, but if I recall correctly I chose xx=01-04 to be on the safe side.
Try using the example above and see if it works better.

The latest version as of today available to download is:

Tried making the examplefiles using serial MTI074042127 and they failed. Using serial MTI035248989 everything was ok.
