for full edition the "general form" of key is:

XXXA-CXXX-XXXA-AUSI

replace "X" with char from "A" to "Z"

you can confirm if you look at the edition.txt
it must says: The Full Edition libraries for the MPLAB C32 C Compiler have been installed.

----------------------------------
If I understand it correctly, you can replace "X" with any character from "A" to "Z"

example:
XXXA-CXXX-XXXA-AUSI

replaced "X" then:

BCDA-CFGH-WRTA-AUSI

Somebody tried it and confirmed it works?
